# DeepGraLog
A sort of Log Anomaly Detection method based on Graph Representation Learning.</br>
We have made the following modifications for this project:</br>

1.Modified the log format and eliminated redundant log information to facilitate data processing.</br>
2.Four types of defects are injected into system code.(see comments section)</br>
...
# Dataset
The dataset includes 6,785,624log messages which are combined with invocation information of
the system source code files, and among the log messages,894,955(13.19%) are anomalous ones caused by the four faults
injected in. </br>
